### CompetiTrees Description

CompetiTrees is a mobile friendly web app that incentivises eco friendly travel options by gamifying their use of green travel. Users can earn leaf points by saving on emissions and spend their leaf points on rewards, such as discounts for coffee. Users can also earn virtual rewards such as badges for achieving milestones.
Users can compete with friends solo or in teams to earn the most leaf points. And have the option to donate to plant a native tree.

### HackChCh

hackChch is your opportunity to use what youâ€™ve learned in your studies to bring an innovative idea to life. The 48 hour hackathon takes place on the 4th & 5th of September and takes inspiration from the Smart Christchurch programme created by the Christchurch City Council. 

hackChch is a fully remote event!

Over the 48 hour period teams will be challenged to address these problems by developing innovative solutions including prototypes which they will present to an expert panel of judges. 

At the end of the hackathon our expert panel of judges will select the top three teams to share a prize pool of $2000.
